## 1. 前言

根据RaftServerImpl构造器中对ServerState的初始化

**this.state = new ServerState(id, group, stateMachine, this, option, properties);**

可以看出，ServerState是跟RaftServerImpl是统一层面的概念

## 2. ServerState

### 1. 实例变量

```java
  private final RaftGroupMemberId memberId; 
  private final RaftServerImpl server;
  /** Raft log */
  private final MemoizedSupplier<RaftLog> log;
  /** Raft configuration */
  private final ConfigurationManager configurationManager;
  /** The thread that applies committed log entries to the state machine */
  private final MemoizedSupplier<StateMachineUpdater> stateMachineUpdater;
  /** local storage for log and snapshot */
  private final MemoizedCheckedSupplier<RaftStorageImpl, IOException> raftStorage;
  private final SnapshotManager snapshotManager;
  private volatile Timestamp lastNoLeaderTime;
  private final TimeDuration noLeaderTimeout;

  private final ReadRequests readRequests;

  /**
   * Latest term server has seen.
   * Initialized to 0 on first boot, increases monotonically.
   */
  private final AtomicLong currentTerm = new AtomicLong();
  /**
   * The server ID of the leader for this term. Null means either there is
   * no leader for this term yet or this server does not know who it is yet.
   */
  private volatile RaftPeerId leaderId;
  /**
   * Candidate that this peer granted vote for in current term (or null if none)
   */
  private volatile RaftPeerId votedFor;

  /**
   * Latest installed snapshot for this server. This maybe different than StateMachine's latest
   * snapshot. Once we successfully install a snapshot, the SM may not pick it up immediately.
   * Further, this will not get updated when SM does snapshots itself.
   */
  private final AtomicReference<TermIndex> latestInstalledSnapshot = new AtomicReference<>();
```
